Start the server with ./server_dbe & command.
The server can use another then default (2000) port for communication with the IOC.
Another port can be selected by starting the server with comman line argument:
./server_dbe <port> &

for example ./server_dbe 2001 &

In our test case two servers should be started as below:
./server_dbe &
./server_dbe 2001 &
